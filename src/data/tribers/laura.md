After 6 years of working as a PHP Developer on a schools software management information system, I was looking to give something new a whirl and found the tribe. Dealing with schools for many years has allowed me to feel I'm doing some good in the world and I look forward to continuing that with Neontribe.

Outside of work, I have a very loud and fluffy cat by the name of Raymond. He can often be heard shouting at me when I'm in meetings.
