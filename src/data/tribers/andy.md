I was adopted by Neontribe in 2012, rescued from redundancy. I have been working in the industry for two and a half decades. Neontribe also sponsors my degree in Computer Science with the Open University. I love working on tech-for-good projects and building infrastructure from open source components. Working with the other members of the tribe opened my eyes to working in an environment that fosters growth and teamwork. When I'm not working I'm Interested in cooking, gaming and slouching. I am a host for the Lave Radio podcast, and occasionally can be found streaming on Twitch.
