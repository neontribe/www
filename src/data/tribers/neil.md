As the youngest surviving member of the original founders of Neontribe, I still remember when Norwich didn’t have broadband (with was this century). Fortunately, times have moved on and I now help Neontribe and our customers manage Cybersecurity, ISO 27001 and GDPR plus all the other required bureaucracy. As some light relief, I take scouts away on summer camp and help ensure my hobby of live-action role-play runs smoothly by deploying camping and scouting skills in fields throughout the year.
