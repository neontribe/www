After experimenting with online coding courses, I committed to becoming a developer by undertaking a Computing & Game Development degree as a mature student at Plymouth University. After graduating, I started my own one-person game development company and met Neontribe by chance while exhibiting a game at a local conference. Iâ€™ve been working for Neontribe ever since, mostly on the front end of social good projects. I enjoy playing and making video games, board games, most sports and opening new tabs.
