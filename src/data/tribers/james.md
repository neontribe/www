After graduating from a Computing course I worked in mainly content management roles using some dev skills. I occasionally freelanced on the side and then eventually stepped into an official Web Development role where I worked on custom WordPress themes and plugins. I've always kept up my knowledge on recent trends in the web space so learning React JS was a given amongst a few other frameworks such as Liquid and Twig. I'm an "active" Vegan, I use air quotes around active because I have a bad chocolate habit.... no judgement please :)
