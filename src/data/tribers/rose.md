After spending over 4 years in the charity sector, in a range of organisations from student unions to mental health, I found myself drawn to digital. During my time in the sector, I was unknowingly dabbling in user research and UX design. Falling into all the pitfalls that you can make when doing digital in the charity sector for the first time. Learning from my mistakes led me to Neontribe and I now enjoy making as many as I can quickly and failing upwards with the aim of hopefully making the world a little better.
