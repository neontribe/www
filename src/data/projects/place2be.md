  Parenting Smart - digital parenting advice
client: |
  Place2Be
problem: |
  Place2Be faced overwhelming demand for parenting support but had limited resources with which to broaden their reach. The organisation needed to explore how a digital component could build on existing face-to-face services and deliver help nationally. Key unknowns included what parents wanted from online support and whether they would use it.
solution: |
  - Conducted in-depth user research
  - Developed and tested digital prototypes
  - Identified user needs of parents
  - Explored optimal content, format and tone
  - Developed an online repository of advice in video and text format
