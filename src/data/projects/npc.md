  Helping young people find the services they need

problem: |
  The internet plays a huge role in all our lives, but it’s not clear today that it helps young people to address important issues and challenges that face them, like mental health, housing advice and support and sexual health. In fact, it is much easier for a young person to find their nearest takeaway than it is for them to find the support or opportunities that they need. From Demonstrating the value of digital signposting, by NPC:

  Signposting+ is a collaborative programme that aims to ensure that young people can find the right information and support online about the things that matter to them. Neontribe’s involvement was to ensure the voices of young people themselves were heard through quality user research.

solution: |
  - Facilitated workshops with a cohort of young people
  - Delivered usability testing of four signposting services.
  - Identified the data that young people found most useful when being signposted to services
  - Distilled their experience of the partner sites into recommendations for improvements
