  Helping more than 450 services across the UK hear young people’s voices
client: |
  Mind Of My Own
problem: |
  Young people were always being asked to fill in paper forms and had know way of keeping track of whether they were heard. The Mind of my Own team came together to see if digital technology could make it easier for young people to get their social workers to listen to them. They discovered that apps could do this. These apps need to be appealing to young people, tailored to their needs, easy to use for workers, safe and secure.
solution: |
  - Starting in 2015 with a learn, build, measure approach funded by Nominet. We used paper prototypes, tests and experiments.
  - Helping the Mind of my Own team learn about user research, service design and product management
  - Providing expertise on information security so that all Mind of my Own’s apps meet ISO27001 and GDPR standards
  - Building and improving the apps which are now used by over 100 organisations to talk with the young people in their care.
