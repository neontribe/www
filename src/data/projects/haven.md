  Exploring whether visual storytelling persuades more people to seek help earlier.

  Working with women at The Haven Wolverhampton
problem: |
  Abusive behaviour in a relationship can be hard to recognise. Women experiencing abuse often are unaware that support is available. Online support tools can be jargon laden and lack relatable examples.
solution: |
  Women who had been through this journey themselves encouraged us to focus on breaking down the fears and barriers to getting help. We built an app that combines womens’ stories with illustrations and encourages people to call a helpline.  We’re also testing whether the app can be used with different content for other support services.
