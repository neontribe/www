client: |
  Simple technology to help more young families get fresh fruit and veg
problems: |
  The Rose Voucher fruit and veg project provides vouchers for families. When our work together began, people involved in the project were writing out lists by hand. Alexandra Rose’s administrator was typing up the information into spreadsheets. They wanted to use technology to reach more families but had limited budgets.
solution: |
* Researching and testing prototypes with traders and children’s centre staff. 
* Mapping the journey of vouchers and the feelings of families and workers.
* Throwing out “great” solutions when they turned out not to fit reality.
* Building the technology in stages, starting in the place where we could make the biggest impact 
* Creating a system that currently supports over 2000 families to get fresh fruit and veg every week
* Supporting the charity to make successful funding bids to Comic Relief, Esmee Fairbairn and National Lottery Community Foundation.
