  Simple technology to help more young families get fresh fruit and veg
client: |
  Alexandra Rose Charity
problem: |
  The Rose Voucher fruit and veg project provides vouchers for families. When our work together began, people involved in the project were writing out multiple lists by hand. Alexandra Rose’s administrator was typing up the information into spreadsheets. They wanted to use technology to reach more families but had limited budgets.
solution: |
  - Researching and testing prototypes with traders and children’s centre staff. 
  - Mapping the journey of vouchers and the feelings of families and workers.
  - Building the technology in stages, starting in the place where we could make the biggest impact. 
  - Creating a bespoke digital system that supports over 1900 families - it uses PHP, Laravel, Javascript, Typescript,  HTML and CSS..
  - Supporting the charity to make successful funding bids
