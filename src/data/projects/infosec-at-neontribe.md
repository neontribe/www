client: |
  Infosec at Neontribe
problem: |
  Charities are subject to the same infosecurity challenges as any organisation. Yet charities are often heavily constrained by budget, and seldom have dedicated infosec staff. Knowledge of information security issues has to permeate the entire organisation to avoid risk to often vulnerable beneficiaries.
solution: |
  - In developing digital services in ways that can be certified to ISO 27001:2022
  - In helping small organisations fulfill the requirements of data protection regulations 
  - In teaching the basics of information security
