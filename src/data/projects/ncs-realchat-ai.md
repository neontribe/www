  Helping young people to understand and use generative AI in positive ways.
client: |
  NCS and CAST
problem: |
  The National Citizen Service and Centre for the Acceleration of Social Technology asked us “How might we support young people to become thoughtful makers and critical users of AI?”

  We worked with 15 – 17 year olds from youth organisations Beats Bus, The Politics Project and Warrington Youth Zone to help provide an answer.

  Young people are the ones who will be living with this technology and this is about empowering them with the ability to embrace the opportunity AI offers safely and thoughtfully.

solution: |
  - Co-created a digital tool with young people
  - Developed a website that wrapped AI output with critical context
  - Showed an AI's critique of its own responses
  - Built in robust safeguards for privacy and safety
  - Focused on clear, accessible language.
