# :computer: Neontribe Website

The neontribe MVP with static HTML, CSS, and JS.

## :checkered_flag: Quick start

1.  **Prerequisites**

    - git
    - [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

    A standalon version of Yarn is bundled with the project.

1.  **Get up and running**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:neontribe/www.git
    cd www
    nvm use
    yarn
    yarn develop
    ```

    :warning: `git clone` might not work if you are not the owner of the directory where you want to clone this repository. The following error might be thrown: `Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository.` If that happens, change ownership of that directory `sudo chown <username>: <path-to-directory> -R`.

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## :wrench: Maintenance :construction:

Please use `yarn` to manage the dependencies and scripts in this project. You shouldn't have to worry about which version you have, so long as it is better than 1.0.1. This system will take care of the details.

1. **Keeping your local copy up to date**

   It's a good idea check that your node version and dependencies are in sync. When you pull from a branch, we suggest running these commands to be sure:

   ```sh
   nvm use
   yarn
   ```

   As of December 2021 the `main` branch was renamed from `master`. If you have a local copy of the site installed before this date you will need to update your local clone of the project.

   From the local clone of the repository on a computer, run the following commands to update the name of the default branch.

   ```sh
   git branch -m OLD-BRANCH-NAME NEW-BRANCH-NAME
   git fetch origin
   git branch -u origin/NEW-BRANCH-NAME NEW-BRANCH-NAME
   git remote set-head origin -a
   ```

1. **Adding dependencies**

   The best way to add a new dependency is via `yarn` as follows:

   ```sh
   yarn add --exact some-cool-package
   ```

   If the package is part of the test or build tools for this project please be sure to add `--dev`.

   \*_why `--exact`? To avoid problems with dependencies updating unexpectedly because of semver masking we want to "pin" them to a specific version number. This will also help our robots when they want to tell us about updates._

1. **Maintaining dependencies**

   If you want to check for and update to new versions of our dependencies manually, the easiest way to do so is by running:

   ```sh
   yarn upgrade-interactive --latest
   ```

   This will give you a nice menu of updates to choose from and will maintain `package.json` and `yarn.lock` automatically.

1. **Updating Yarn**

   A standalone version of Yarn is included in [./.yarn/](./.yarn/). This is to make sure everyone making changes to the site is using the same version, regardless of what they may have installed. To update this:

   1. Download a new version from [Yarn's releases page](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/releases)
   1. Replace the existing version in [./.yarn/](./.yarn/)
   1. Update the yarn-path in [./.yarnrc](./.yarnrc)
   1. Update the version in engines.yarn in [package.json](./package.json)

## :rocket: Deployment

The website is deployed using `now.sh`. The production website reflects the `main` branch. Pull requests which are made against main are considered staging branches.

1. When contributing to the project you need to follow our development process. Please go and read [these instructions ./CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-started-on-development).
1. Beware, the website uses continuous deployments. **When you merge into main the change will shortly be available on the production site.**

Please read the [./now.json configuration](./now.json) if you need more infrastructure specific information. [The documentation for the content of the configuration file is on the zeit website](https://zeit.co/docs/configuration#introduction/configuration-reference).

## :construction_worker: Adding `tribers`

To add yourself or another colleague to the `tribers`, you need to:

1. navigate to `src/data/tribers`
2. create a markdown file titled `first-name.md` -> e.g. in the command line you can do `touch jane.md`
3. add content and here is an example markdown file with all of the features you can have in it, exhaustively:

```sh
    ---
    name: 'Jane Doe'
    words:
      - Words
      - Go
      - Here
    image: images/jane.jpg
    story: stories/jane.md
    social:
      twitter: 'janedoe'
      github: 'doej'
      linkedin: 'jane-doe'     # this must be the bit after `in/` for your public linkedin profile URL
      instagram: 'janeyd'
      twitch: 'jdoegaming'
      facebook: 'jane.doe'
      youtube: 'janedoe'
    ---

    Your bio goes here
```
:rotating_light: You must follow the format included above and don't add more than five social links because they won't all fit.

4. add a photo of you in the `src/data/tribers/images` directory.

:triangular_flag_on_post: Make sure that the name will match the one inserted next to the image field in the markdown file (see previous step).

5. commit your changes and make a pull request

## :recycle: Updating `tribers`

Don't like your bio? Want to change your words? Or maybe just add/remove your social media link(s)? You can change all of these in the `src/data/tribers` directory.

1. find the related markdown file and edit it as needed and/or replace the image in the `src/data/tribers/images` directory

2. commit your changes and make a pull request
